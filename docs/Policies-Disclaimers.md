## Data Usage Policy and Telemetry

SpectraGuru does not collect or track user statistics. We are committed to user privacy and confidentiality; thus, we do not monitor or store any information processed within SpectraGuru Streamlit applications. The only user interaction we record is a basic count of accesses, implemented through a minimal trigger that displays on the welcome page. This ensures that all user data remains entirely within the user’s control and is not accessible to external parties.
