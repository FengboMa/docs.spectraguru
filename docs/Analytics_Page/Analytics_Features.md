|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Average Plot with Original Spectra                  | Visualize original data, visualize standard deviation and mean spectrum                  |              |
| Confidence Interval Plot                            | Visualize standard deviation and mean spectrum                                           |              |
| Correlation Heatmap                                 | Quantify similarities between spectra trends in a grid format                            |              |
| Peak Identification and Stats                       | Identify and classify peaks in spectra intensity                                         |              |
| Hierarchically-clustered Heatmap                    | Group spectra with similar spectra, visualize differences with a color mapping           |              |
| Principal Component Analysis (PCA)                  | Simplify data by reducing it to a small list of components, useful for identifying noise |              |
| T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) | Visualize clustering of high-dimensional data in 2D                                      |              |
