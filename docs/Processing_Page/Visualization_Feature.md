## Visualization 

The application also provides a flexible and interactive visualization platform using [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html). Users can plot their processed spectra, choose specific spectra for visualization, and toggle between a fast plotting mode for large datasets and a more detailed interactive mode for smaller datasets.
