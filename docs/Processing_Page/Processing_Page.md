# Processing Page
{: .no_toc }

This page is dedicated to the processing and visualization of uploaded spectral data, with a particular focus on Raman spectroscopy. The application provides a comprehensive suite of tools through a user-friendly sidebar interface, allowing users to efficiently manipulate their spectral data. Available processing steps include interpolation, cropping, despiking, smoothing, baseline removal, normalization, and outlier removal. These functionalities enable users to meticulously refine your data, ensuring it is optimally prepared for further analysis and visualization.


## General Operation

To begin, select the desired processing function from the sidebar. After making selections, click the "Process" button to apply the changes. If at any point users wish to revert to the original data, simply click the "Reset" button.

The updated visualization will automatically appear on the right side of the page.

If users choose not to apply any processing and prefer to visualize the raw data, users can do so by clicking the "Plot" button in the main area of the page.
